    A balanced diet is the cornerstone of good health. Eating a varied diet that includes the major food groups ensures you get the spectrum of macronutrients and micronutrients crucial for preventing disease. To make the food groups and the nutritional value of food items easier to understand, the United States Department of Agriculture developed the MyPlate food reference, which replaces the old food pyramid. Using this as a guide makes it easier to choose healthy things to eat at every meal.
